This theme is a **Mobile First** version of GenesisChild - https://github.com/neilgee/genesischild

This is a basic starter **Genesis Child Theme** to be used with the **Genesis Framework** on **WordPress**.

This GenesisChild theme has a number of widgets areas, the majority are Front Page only.

### Home Page
The Home Page has been widgetized and the default Genesis loop can be removed.


To remove the Genesis home page loop edit the **front-page.php** file by uncommenting line 88:
```php
gc_genesis_no_content();
```

and commenting line 90:
```php
//genesis();
```

### Example

### Menus
- Primary Menu is positioned above Header Right Widget Hook and is set to Primary Location
- Secondary Menu remains in default area and is Secondary Location spanning full width below the logo/header right.
- Responsive menu is added but not enabled, to enable it uncomment in *functions.php* line 39 *	// include_once( get_stylesheet_directory() . '/includes/responsive-menu.php' );*

### Custom Logo
- Custom Logo is supported via the Customizer, suggested size is 400x150px which you can change in the *add_theme_support('custom-logo')* array in *functions.php*
- The header logo  uses an `<img>` element and can support the SVG format.
- SVGs are set to be allowed for upload by the constant 'ALLOW_UNFILTERED_UPLOADS' declared in *functions.php*

### Background Image
- Background Images is supported, a background image can be uploaded in the WP Dashboard via Appearance > Background, this will scale to fit any viewport via BackStretchJS.

To use this you have to enable the BackStretch script in */includes/scripts-styles.php* at line 54
